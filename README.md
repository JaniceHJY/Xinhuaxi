# Simple Personal Care Website — PureBloom (example)

What you get:
- index.html — landing page and structure
- styles.css — responsive styles with CSS variables (customize primary color)
- script.js — small interactions (mobile nav, footer year)
- README with customization + deployment notes

How to use locally:
1. Put `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` in the same folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

Customization tips:
- Brand name: replace "PureBloom" in `index.html` (title, header, footer, and copy).
- Colors: change `--primary` in `styles.css`.
- Images: replace Unsplash URLs in `index.html` with your product images (add alt text).
- Contact form: replace the `action` URL in the form with your Formspree endpoint or your server endpoint. Alternately use `mailto:` links for basic email behavior.
- Add real shop links: the product "View" buttons can link to product pages or cart.

Deploying:
- GitHub Pages: create a repo, push files to `main` (or `gh-pages`), then enable Pages in repo settings (use root branch).
- Netlify / Vercel: connect the repo and deploy; both detect static HTML automatically.

Next steps I can do for you (pick any):
- Apply your brand name, logo, and color palette.
- Add a product detail page template and a basic cart (localStorage).
- Convert to a template for Shopify / WooCommerce / Webflow.
- Generate product images (placeholders) or recommend stock photos.

Tell me your brand name, primary color, and one sample product name and I'll update the site copy and colors for you.
